Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting heart failure using Machine Learning algorithms in Python. The dataset was sourced online and preprocessed by handling missing values with Power Query. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including a heatmap to visualize data correlations.

Key Steps:
âœ” Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, categorized numerical and categorical features, and applied encoding techniques.
âœ” Dataset Splitting: Divided the data into training and testing sets for effective model evaluation.
âœ” Model Implementation: Used Scikit-Learn to train and evaluate five ML models:

Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
âœ” Performance Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy between 81% â€“ 87% across models.
Tech Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Python | Pandas | NumPy | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Scikit-Learn

This project showcases my expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model evaluation for real-world healthcare applications.
